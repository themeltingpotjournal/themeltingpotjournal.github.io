    <h3>Submission Guidelines</h3>
<p>Your submission must be related to U.S. History and Culture, and should attempt to document or celebrate diversity and differences between populations. We highly encourage stories about immigrants and immigration, Americans' experiences in other countries, and other topics that allow us to understand U.S. culture(s) in a global context.
</p>
<p>This might look different across genres and authors - you might choose to write about family history or your own personal experiences, write about an event in history and the impact it had, or create a video showcasing some of your family's cultural traditions.
</p>
</p>
<h3>Technical Requirements for Text Submissions</h3>
<p>Submissions should follow word length requirements specified below:
<ul>
  <li>- Creative nonfiction (Max length: 1200 words)</li>
<li>- Creative fiction (Max length: 5000 words)</li>
<li>- Poetry (Max length: 20 lines)</li>
</ul>
<p>Written submissions should be formatted in 12pt Times New Roman, double-spaced, and submitted in .doc or .docx format (or as a Google Doc) through the form (link at top of page).
</p>
<h3>Technical Requirements for Visual Art Submissions</h3>
<p>Our journal also accepts submissions of visual art. This includes objects like photographs, digital or traditional art, and even videos! All submissions should have a title and description which you can provide in the submission form.
</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>- Images: </strong>We ask that any images you submit are under 1MB in size, in a PNG, JPG, or PDF format by using the form.</li>
<li><strong>- Videos: </strong>We ask that you submit videos to us by first uploading your video to Youtube, then sending us a link in the form.</li>
</ul>

<h3>How to Submit Your Work</h3>
<p>To submit your work to our journal, follow the steps below:</p>
<ul>- Go to <a href="https://goo.gl/forms/TLYj58bGpHaIoOk23">https://goo.gl/forms/TLYj58bGpHaIoOk23</a></li>
  <li>- Complete the form to the best of your abilities. You are required to complete some information about yourself, as well as a brief title and description of your submission.</li>

</ul>
<h3>What else should I know?</h3>
<p>Before you submit, here are a few other details to keep in mind:</p>
  <ul>
<li>- At The Melting Pot, we don’t believe that being published in one literary magazine gives a writer the reach they deserve. Because of this, we have zero qualms against printing pieces that have already been published elsewhere.</li>
<li>- We do not currently offer any monetary compensation for being published in The Melting Pot, but will provide each writer who is published with us a complimentary print and digital copy of the issue they appear in.</li>
<li>- Writers and artists maintain all rights to their own work when submitting to/publishing with The Melting Pot. We only ask for one-time publication rights. Should we wish to re-publish any work in any type of anthology or “Best of” issue, we will ask each contributor individually and separately from his/her original contract.</li>
<li>- By submitting to our journal, you are stating that you are the sole author of the work, that the work does not infringe on any other rights, and that you are the exclusive owner of the rights you are conveying to the journal.</li>
</ul>
